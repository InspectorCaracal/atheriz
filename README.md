# AtheriZ

A text-based multiplayer game server.

This has some code from Evennia, and is loosely based on the same ideas.

Currently only supports web clients.

This is a very early draft and is not ready for production use.

TODO:

- docs
- more tests
- scripts
- tick system (already there, just need to activate it)
- time system (already done, just needs to be added)
- pathfinding (already done, just needs to be added)
- door stuff + ability for custom doors
- build command colors
